# HelseAPI

Developing of standardized open APIs for Norwegian healthcare based on HL7 FHIR.

## Plan

Still in concept phase, the plan is to make a library of profiles based on ideas from Argonaut/US Core (minimum data set for query).  The profiles will make use of Norwegian [base profiles (no-basis) for R4](https://github.com/HL7Norway/basisprofiler-r4) (still only on STU3 as of writing).
